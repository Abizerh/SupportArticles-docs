# Error "The namespace cannot be queried. The system cannot find the file specified" with DFS Namespaces

This article helps resolve the error "The namespace cannot be queried. The system cannot find the file specified."

You might receive the following error message when you access, modify, or create a Distributed File System (DFS) Namespace on a DFS Namespace server, domain member server, or Windows client with File Services tools (included in Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)) installed.

> The namespace cannot be queried. The system cannot find the file specified

## The registry entry or values are corrupt, modified, or missing

This error generally occurs when you access a DFS stand-alone namespace using the DFS Management console. The cause is that the entire or parts of the registry key for the DFS stand-alone namespace are missing on the DFS Namespace server (locally).

If you check the registry under the following registry key, the registry entry for the DFS Namespace root or other registry values in the registry subkeys of the DFS root are corrupt, modified, or missing.

`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DFS\Roots\Standalone\`

> [!NOTE]
> If you restart the DFS server service on the affected DFS Namespace server (holding the DFS stand-alone namespace), you'll receive the error "The Namespace cannot be queried. Element not found" while trying to reload or access the DFS stand-alone namespace from the DFS Management console.

### Wireshark trace example

See the following Wireshark tracing on a member server or member client with RSAT File Services Tools installed.

```output
192.168.0.45	192.168.0.42	NETDFS	310	dfs_GetInfo request
192.168.0.42	192.168.0.45	NETDFS	214	dfs_GetInfo response, Error: WERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```

## Import the registry key from a valid registry backup

> [!NOTE]
> After you apply the solution, remove the DFS Namespace from the DFS Management console and add it back, or close and reopen the console to make the changes to take effect.

[!INCLUDE [Registry important alert](../../includes/registry-important-alert.md)]

Importing the registry key for the DFS Namespace root from a valid registry backup (if available) of the same registry key can resolve the issue.

If no backup is present and since in a DFS stand-alone namespace configuration, you have only a single DFS root server, the only option is to delete the DFS Namespace, perform a DFS Namespace cleanup on the DFS root server and re-create the DFS Namespace.

> [!NOTE]
> Restart the DFS server service, so that the changes in the registries are loaded again into memory. Not restarting the DFS server or the DFS server service may result in the same error.
