# Connection Creation failing with "This computer is not joined Microsoft Entra or the domain." or "MachineNotJoined"

## Symptoms

- Error Message: `Failed to create OAuth connection: ClientError: Test connection failed. Details: Connection failed: [Machine <machineid>] This computer has not joined Microsoft Entra or the domain.`
- Error Code `MachineNotJoined` and error message `The machine is neither Microsoft Entra nor domain joined`.

## Cause

Your machine isn't properly joined to either Microsoftâ€¯Entra or a Domain which is a prerequisite to be able to use the "Connect with Sign-in" feature.

## Resolution

### Option 1: Join your device to Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra join can be accomplished using self-service options like the Out of Box Experience (OOBE), bulk enrollment, or Windows Autopilot. You can read more about [Microsoft Entra joined devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/devices/concept-directory-join)

### Option 2: Use another connection option

If you can't join your device to Microsoft Entra ID, you can update your connections and select the option to connect with username and password.
