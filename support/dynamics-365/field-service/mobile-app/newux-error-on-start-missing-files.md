# Error on start due to missing files in the solution

## Symptoms

An error occurs when starting the new mobile app experience stating files are missing.

## Resolution

Some required source records are missing. These records should be created when installing the solution. In rare cases, these records don't get created successfully or corrupted. In some cases, a user deleted the records.

### Step 1: Check if the mobilesource table contains data

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) and open the environment to check.

1. Select **Tables**, choose the **All** filter and search for the table `MobileSource (msdyn_mobilesource)`.

1. Select the table and verify if the table contains the following data in the **Name** column:

   - /card/bookingListViewItem.yml
   - /card/defaultViewItem.yml
   - /card/serviceTaskGridItem.yml
   - /sitemaps/mobile.yml

If there's no data in the table, something went wrong with the solution update.

### Step 2: Apply the Field Service solution update again

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), open your environment and go to **Solutions**.

1. Search for `fieldservice_anchor` and delete the `FieldService_Anchor` solution.

1. Go to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments) and select the environment in which you deleted the solution.

1. In the environment details, under **Resources**, select **Dynamics 365 applications**.

1. Select **Install app**, choose **Dynamics 365 for Field Service**, and select **Next**.

1. Accept the terms of service and select **Install**.

After installing the solution, [verify that the table now contains the required data](#step-1-check-if-the-mobilesource-table-contains-data).
