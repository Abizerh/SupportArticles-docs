# The new experience doesn't show dashboards from the navigation

## Symptoms

Dashboards configured in the navigation aren't supported. Selecting a dashboard from the new UX results in an error. When a dashboard is configured as the first entity in the navigation for the new experience, the home experience doesn't render correctly.

## Resolution

Remove dashboards from the navigation until it's officially supported.
